This repository houses the frontend component of Explorer. Developed with TypeScript, React.js, and mui, it showcases a user-friendly interface that presents the Cardano blockchain data collected and aggregated by LedgerSync.

## Prerequisites

In order to build and run everything you will need:

- Node version: ^v14.19.0 ([^v16.16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/) recommended)
- npm: ^6.14.17

## Install and run

Install the app with npm (it's work well with `yarn` but we using npm in here):

**Step 1**: Install packages
Open terminal and run commad: `npm install`

**Step 2**: Create .env file from .env.example
In the terminal run command: `cp .env.example .env`

**Step 3** Update env variables:

- Update port for application.

  > Example: `PORT=3000`

- Update API URL for explorer service.

  > Example: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`

- Update WebSocket URL for real-time expolorer service.

  > Example: `REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws`

- Update API URL for authentication service.

  > Example: `REACT_APP_AUTH_API_URL=http://localhost:8081`

- Update APP URL for other network. Example:

  ```
  REACT_APP_TESTNET_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
  REACT_APP_PREVIEW_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
  REACT_APP_PREPROD_APP_URL=http://localhost:3002
  REACT_APP_MAINNET_APP_URL=http://localhost:3003
  ```

- Update Jira Embedded Key to Add Jira Support Widget to explorer

  > Example: `REACT_APP_JSD_WIDGET_KEY=xxx`

- Update link to the cardano price

  > Example: `REACT_APP_EXT_ADA_PRICE_URL=https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cardano`

- Update link to the cardano news

  > Example: `REACT_APP_CARDANO_NEWS_URL=https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news`

- Update application network (`mainnet`, `preprod` or `preview`)

  > Example: `REACT_APP_NETWORK=mainnet`

- Configure supported network names (`mainnet`, `preprod` or `preview`)
  > Example: `REACT_APP_NETWORK_NAMES="{"mainnet":"Mainnet","preprod":"Preprod", ...}"`

**Step 4** Run on localhost

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open terminal and run command: `npm start`

The application will run by default on port 3000. If you want to run the application on another port, please change the `PORT` in the .env file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing with Jest

This app uses `Jest` for Unit test.

To run your tests, execute the following command:

- `npm run jest-test` to test all file `*.test.ts`.

- `npm run jest-test-one [file_relative_path]` to test a file with `[file_relative_path]` being relative path of file. Ex: `npm run jest-test-one src\commons\utils\helper.test.ts`

## E2e test with Cypress

This app we use `Cypress` for e2e testing.

You can run it with following commands:

Open Launchpad:
Run `npm run cypress:open` to open Cypress launchpad.

On opening Cypress, your testing journey begins with the Launchpad. Its job is to guide you through the decisions and configuration tasks you need to complete before you start writing your first test.

To run e2e test with all specs, try this command:
`npm run cypress:run`

## Build into production

Execute `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
