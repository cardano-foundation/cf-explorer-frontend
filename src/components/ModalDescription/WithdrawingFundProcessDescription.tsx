            When a delegator wants to withdraw their funds from a staking pool on Cardano, the following steps occur:

              The delegator initiates a withdrawal request in their wallet or through a staking service.

              The Cardano protocol verifies that the delegator has enough available funds to cover the transaction fees
              and the amount being withdrawn.

              The Cardano protocol then creates a withdrawal certificate that specifies the amount to be withdrawn and
              the address to which the funds should be sent.

              The withdrawal certificate is broadcast to the network and included in the blockchain, indicating that the
              funds are now available for withdrawal.

              The delegator's funds are then transferred from the staking pool's account to the delegator's address
              specified in the withdrawal certificate.

            <NormalDescription>

              The delegator can then see the withdrawn funds in their wallet or through a staking service.

            It's important to note that there may be a delay between the withdrawal request and the actual transfer of
            funds due to the nature of the Cardano blockchain. The exact time it takes for the withdrawal to complete
            depends on various factors such as network congestion and transaction fees. In summary, when a delegator
            wants to withdraw their funds from a staking pool on Cardano, the Cardano protocol is involved in verifying
            the transaction and creating a withdrawal certificate. Once the certificate is included in the blockchain,
            the funds are transferred to the delegator's address, and the withdrawal is complete.
