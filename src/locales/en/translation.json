This is done by posting a so-called “stake address registration certificate” to the Cardano blockchain. This registration allows an ADA holder to delegate ADA and automatically sets up a rewards address where the Cardano blockchain accrues the rewards from such delegation (see Delegation and Rewards Collection).\n\nTechnically such a registration is required because delegation on the Cardano blockchain involves distinguishing between the transaction of ADA and the participation of the same ADA in the consensus mechanism. This distinction is achieved by modelling it in the address structure and distinguishing between payment address and stake address. ADA is always linked to a payment address but can optionally also be associated with a stake address. This allows the ADA holder to exercise staking or delegate it to a stake pool selected by the ADA holder.\n\nTo mitigate certain economic attacks, a refundable hold is imposed on the ADA holder upon registration, which is released when the stake address is deregistered. The hold covers the costs of tracking the stake address and maintaining the corresponding rewards account, and it incentivises deregistering unused stake addresses so that the corresponding Cardano blockchain resources can be released.",

If a source stake address is deregistered (see Deregistration), the associated delegation certificate is automatically revoked. Newer delegation certificates supersede older delegation certificates.",

For each stake address, there is an associated reward account. The lifecycle of the reward account follows that of the associated stake address. They cannot receive funds via transactions. Instead, their balance is only increased when rewards are distributed and decreased only when rewards are withdrawn. Thereby, the rewards from multiple epochs can be accumulated, and ADA holders can withdraw them manually. The balance of the reward account is included in the stake associated with the stake address, thus there is no incentive to frequently withdraw rewards.\n\nTechnically, the reward account maps a stake address to its reward balance. Since all the information relevant to calculating rewards is publicly available on the blockchain, it's unnecessary to explicitly write the balance of each reward account to the chain. Instead, nodes can store reward accounts and their current balance locally. The reward accounts are updated in bulk by the Cardano blockchain following the end of an epoch. They are also consulted and updated when validating and applying transactions that withdraw from reward accounts. The rewards for epoch “e” depend on the contents of that epoch, so it is not feasible to start calculating them during that epoch. Rewards for epoch e are therefore distributed by the Cardano blockchain at the beginning of e+2, which allows for reward calculation during epoch e+1. Reward accounts use account-type architecture instead of the Unspent-Transaction-Output (UTXO) architecture.",

The certificate contains the parameters required to set up and operationalize the stake pool, such as operator and owner addresses, stake pool metadata, and reward-sharing parameters. Such parameters include but are not limited to cost, margin, and amount of stake pledged to the pool by the operator or owner (see below for more on this distinction). Click on the stake pool registration certificate for the full list of parameters.\n\nTechnically there is a difference between the stake pool operator and stake pool owner(s). The stake pool operator operates and monitors the pool by owning or renting a server to run the node and holding the key(s) to the pool. There is generally only one stake pool operator who holds the key to the stake pool itself that is used to sign blocks, retire a stake pool, update registration certificates and distribute rewards among the stake pool owners. The Stake Pool Owner pledges their staking authority to the pool, increasing its rewards and desirability. The ability for the owner to pledge stake mitigates against certain pool-level attacks (e.g. sybil). Often, the operator and owner will be the same party, but a stake pool can also have multiple owners. This allows multiple parties to coordinate to form a competitive stake pool, by combining the stake of the involved parties (owners), thereby increasing the total pledge.",

The certificate contains the parameters required to set up and operationalize the stake pool, such as operator and owner addresses, stake pool metadata, and reward-sharing parameters. Such parameters include but are not limited to cost, margin, and amount of stake pledged to the pool by the operator or owner (see below for more on this distinction). Click on the stake pool registration certificate for the full list of parameters.",
  "desc.RegistrationSPOProcessDescription.2st": " Technically there is a difference between the stake pool operator and stake pool owner(s). The stake pool operator operates and monitors the pool by owning or renting a server to run the node and holding the key(s) to the pool. There is generally only one stake pool operator who holds the key to the stake pool itself that is used to sign blocks, retire a stake pool, update registration certificates and distribute rewards among the stake pool owners. The Stake Pool Owner pledges their staking authority to the pool, increasing its rewards and desirability. The ability for the owner to pledge stake mitigates against certain pool-level attacks (e.g. sybil). Often, the operator and owner will be the same party, but a stake pool can also have multiple owners. This allows multiple parties to coordinate to form a competitive stake pool, by combining the stake of the involved parties (owners), thereby increasing the total pledge.",
